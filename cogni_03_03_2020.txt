SERIES & Propagation

4:05 reassemble!

per 1000 lines of data
0.5% <- allowed to lose 
<5 -> don't worry about them drop
> 5 -> find a way adjust or drop
How to adjust?
- Mode
- Median
- Mean
- Custom Value
- Custom Function/regular expression


Windows -> LINUX

Installed both OS,

VIRTUALIZATION -> Linux inside Windows
LINUX programs, software think
that they are running on linux 
OWN -> RENTING -. CLOUD Computing
PER HOUR - Infrastructure as a service
network, 
AMI - Azure Image - Google VHDs

Infrastructure as a Service
Platform aaS
Software aaS

Microsoft Virtual Academy->


JUMP HEIGHT-> LOW , HIGHT

MASS increasing -> Jump dec
Height increasing -> jump inc 

Low or HIGH = mass + height 

mass > 30 -> jump low
mass <=30 -> jump high
Height > 3 -> jump high
<3 -> jump low 
BOUNDARY OF DATA 
CREATED a formula!
y =1 for x>0, y =0, x<=0,






dropped a column age -> missing value
after deploying -> data that it gets
Age -> has info
BUT MY ML MODEL DOESN"T KNOW WHAT 
age is?
Web Developer -> making AGE
Store in a local storage->
remove Age and then pass
y = weights*x + bias-> Y is called MODEL 
How to create this Y is ML 
x  -> ML
CONFIGURE

KNOW-> DOCKER -> DEV/TEST/Small use
Kubernetes-> Production/large use




Windows, Python, Tensorflow, 
Platform as a Service


REDUNDANCY -> LOCAL
BUY, MANTAIN, WORRY
SOUTH, CENTRAL -> Regional/ Zonal

COUNTRIES -> Geo 
8 GB ram, 2 GHz CPU
-
Microsoft, Google, Amazon
3 GB ram, 1 GHz CPU 

BIGDATA -> TRAIN, TEST, DEPLOY

SMALL DATA != MACHINE LEARNING
SINGLE MACHINE!= MACHINE LEARNING
ALWAYS A CLUSTER

API-> cloud, flask
(internet)

CONTAINERs->
DOCKERS
KUBERNETES-> SERVICE that manages
computer clusters











 

linear variable -> max 1
quadric -> 2
 y = m1 * 5 Crore + m2 *....
